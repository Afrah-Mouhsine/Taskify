# Taskify
Taskify is a modern, interactive todo application built with React and TypeScript. It allows users to create, manage, and organize tasks with drag-and-drop functionality. Tasks can be marked as completed, edited, or deleted, and they are visually separated into "Active Tasks" and "Completed Tasks" sections.
